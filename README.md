# POPUPBOX

A sensible popupbox, just see the example here and use it. No weird syntax.

`Plugn this in js and change the names`

## How to use : 

It displays a popupbox by making the overlay with the width and height configured as the inner element.

The structure is a nested div (will be charged soon to single div) of the form :

```html
<div id='popupbox'>
    <div id="popupboxcontent">
        Thing that will come up in the popup
    </div>
</div>
```
Where the top one is a placeholder and the inner `popupboxcontent` is the actual content.
You can put this wherever you want in the code. All the linking is in the js.

Now for the css, use this for `popupbox` (this is default and you can reuse it, just remember to make it the highest z-index):
```css
div#popupbox{
    display: none;
    position: absolute;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 100;
}
```
Now inside the `popupboxcontent` as the name suggest put all your content and you are good to go.
Just remember to change the name of the classes in the js accordingly.
```js
$(1).click(function(e){
    e.stopPropagation();
    displayPopup('2', '3');
});
```
```md
1 : Trigger point
2 : The base from which the popup should come up
3 : Actual content
```

Example : 
```js
$('#button').click(function(e){
    e.stopPropagation();
    displayPopup('#button', '#popupboxcontent');
});
```
